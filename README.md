# game-randomizer

A React-based web application that facilitates the randomizing process of setting up board games.

It is temporarily hosted at [gamerandomizer.000webhostapp.com](https://gamerandomizer.000webhostapp.com/) until I manage to secure better lodgings for it.

There will also appear a link to BoardGameGeek forums here, once a thread is started there.

I claim no rights to any of the games supported by the application; these go to their respective designers and/or publishers. See the copyrights section for a temporary listing of these designers and publishers.

There are only three working randomizers for now; more are coming with future releases! The thumbnails are both a sneak-peak into the future and placeholders to make the front page appear less empty.

## Prerequisites

To run the website through a browser, nothing but enabled Javascript is necessary.

For development, [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is sufficient.
