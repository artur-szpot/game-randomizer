# game-randomizer

A React-based web application that facilitates the randomizing process of setting up board games.

It is temporarily hosted at [gamerandomizer.000webhostapp.com](https://gamerandomizer.000webhostapp.com/) until I manage to secure better lodgings for it.

There will also appear a link to BoardGameGeek forums here, once a thread is started there.

I claim no rights to any of the games supported by the application; these go to their respective designers and/or publishers. See the copyrights section in each game's screen for a listing of these designers and publishers.

There are only three working randomizers for now; more are coming with future releases! The thumbnails are both a sneak-peak into the future and placeholders to make the front page appear less empty.

There is now also a link to an alpha version of an app generator, to create the basic structure of an app.

## Prerequisites

To run the website through a browser, nothing but enabled Javascript is necessary.

For development, [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is necessary. The project makes use of TypeScript, so installing the appropriate modules is needed as well:

```npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest```

## Copyrights

Section moved into the application itself.

## Contributions

Any comments, bug reports, ideas or development cooperation offers are welcome.

By the time this project releases in version 1.0, I intend to have a working documentation that should allow anyone with basic knowledge of JavaScript and TypeScript to create their own apps; for now, the priority is getting everything to work.

The project now also includes a "backlog" file under src/backlog.txt. It is not curated for readability, but more a place to store half-baked ideas for future improvements of the application.
