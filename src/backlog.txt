Expand the Generator:
 - add visual preview
 - change the GUI to improve UX:
   - superfluous tabbing

General big ideas:
 - cookies
 - presets
 - reorganizable front page
 - draggable elements (front page/generator)
 - animation upon rows collapsing/expanding
 - changeable color styles

Components:
 - unify hover colors for all buttons in all componentns
 - yesNo: change to the switcher style
 - new: chance: set a chance of X: (slider?) special multistate?
   - rarely: 20%
   - sometimes: 40%
   - often: 60%
   - very often: 80%
   - allow 0 and 100 too for a complete replacement of yesNo (perhaps make yesNo a version of this with disabled middle steps?)

Navbar:
  - move the about section into a separate main-page component?
  - create an actual logo
  - make it implement languages (about section)


  move down after generate is clicked
  icons for components in select boxes (for yes no too)
  min max simplification: needed min, max, min.curr, max.curr
