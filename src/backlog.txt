Expand the Generator:
 - allow setting initial values
 - allow indexed components/results
 - add visual preview
 - for categories, add subtext possibility
 - create several components/results at once
 - change the GUI to improve UX:
   - buttons running away
   - too much space taken by error messages
   - superfluous tabbing

General big ideas:
 - cookies
 - presets
 - reorganizable front page
 - draggable elements (front page/generator)
 - animation upon rows collapsing/expanding
 - changeable color styles

Components:
 - yesNo: change to the switcher style
 - new: chance: set a chance of X: (slider?)
   - rarely: 20%
   - sometimes: 40%
   - often: 60%
   - very often: 80%
   - allow 0 and 100 too for a complete replacement of yesNo (perhaps make yesNo a version of this with disabled middle steps?)

Navbar:
  - move the about section into a separate main-page component?
  - create an actual logo
  - make it implement languages
